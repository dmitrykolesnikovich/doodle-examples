# [Todo](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/tree/master/Todo) Tutorial

This tutorial shows how you might build the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) app using Doodle. This version deviates from the
official app spec in that (like all Doodle apps) it does not use CSS or HTML directly. Therefore, it
does not include the assets provided by the official spec. Instead, it replicates the UX with Doodle
primitives.

This version is also designed to work well as an embedded app. The version below (unlike
the full-screen version) does not use routing for the filters. This means there is no way to deep-link
to a filter, like the full-screen version has. The launch code decides this by injecting a different
strategy for creating the filter buttons, while the app itself is unaware of this difference.

## Project Setup

We will use a multi-platform setup for this app. This is not necessary to use Doodle, but it lets us implement our code almost
entirely in `commonMain` and our tests in `commonTest`. We will then be able to run these tests on the JVM target, which will
make their execution really fast and completely decoupled from the JS environment.

[**build.gradle.kts**](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/Todo/build.gradle.kts)

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform")
}

kotlin {
    // Defined in buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Common.kt
    jsTargets ()
    jvmTargets()

    // Defined in gradle.properties
    val mockkVersion        : String by project
    val doodleVersion       : String by project
    val mockkJsVersion      : String by project
    val coroutinesVersion   : String by project
    val serializationVersion: String by project

    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation(kotlin("stdlib-common"))
                implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core-common:$coroutinesVersion") // async font, image loading
                implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:$serializationVersion" ) // task persistence

                api ("io.nacular.doodle:core:$doodleVersion"    ) // required for Doodle
                api ("io.nacular.doodle:browser:$doodleVersion" ) // required for Doodle in the browser
                api ("io.nacular.doodle:controls:$doodleVersion") // provides things like buttons and panels
            }
        }

       // ...
    }
}
```

## Defining Our Application

All Doodle apps must implement the [`Application`](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Core/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/application/Application.kt#L4)
interface. The framework will then initialize our app via the constructor.

Doodle apps can be defined in `commonMain`, since they do not require any platform-specific dependencies. Therefore, we will do
the same and place ours in `commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/examples`.

[**TodoApp.kt**](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/Todo/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/examples/TodoApp.kt#L11)

```kotlin
class TodoApp(display: Display, /*...*/): Application {
    init {
        // Launch coroutine to fetch fonts/images
        GlobalScope.launch {
            val titleFont  = fonts            { family = "Helvetica Neue"; size = 100; weight = 100 }
            val listFont   = fonts(titleFont) {                            size =  24               }
            val footerFont = fonts(titleFont) {                            size =  10               }

            // install theme
            themes.selected = theme

            display += TodoView(/*...*/)

            display.layout = constrain(display.children[0]) { fill(it) }

            display.fill(config.appBackground.paint)
        }
    }

    override fun shutdown() { /* no-op */ }
}
```

:::tip
Notice that `shutdown` is a no-op, since we don't have any cleanup to do when the app closes.

## Creating A Fullscreen App

Doodle apps can be [launched](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications) in a few different ways.
We create a helper to launch the app in [full screen](https://nacular.github.io/doodle/docs/applications#top-level-apps).

[**FullScreen.kt**](https://github.com/nacular/doodle-tutorials/blob/master/Todo/src/jsMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/examples/FullScreen.kt#L12)

```kotlin
package io.nacular.doodle.examples

//...

fun fullScreen() {
    application(modules = listOf(FontModule, PointerModule, KeyboardModule, basicLabelBehavior(),
        nativeTextFieldBehavior(), nativeHyperLinkBehavior(), nativeScrollPanelBehavior(smoothScrolling = true),
        Module(name = "AppModule") {
            bind<ImageLoader>         () with singleton { ImageLoaderImpl         (instance(), instance()            ) }
            bind<PersistentStore>     () with singleton { LocalStorePersistence   (                                  ) }
            bind<NativeLinkStyler>    () with singleton { NativeLinkStylerImpl    (instance()                        ) }
            bind<DataStore>           () with singleton { DataStore               (instance()                        ) }
            bind<Router>              () with singleton { TrivialRouter           (window                            ) }
            bind<FilterButtonProvider>() with singleton { LinkFilterButtonProvider(instance(), instance(), instance()) }
        }
    )) {
        // load app
        TodoApp(instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance())
    }
}
```
:::tip
Normally this would just be your `main` function. But `main` would prevent the app from being used as a library. Which
is what happens to allow both an embedded (in the docs) and full-screen version.
:::

Use the `application` function to launch top-level apps. It takes a list of modules, and a lambda that builds the
app. This lambda is within a Kodein injection context, which means we can inject dependencies into our app via
`instance`, `provider`, etc.

Notice that we have included several modules for our app. This includes one for fonts, pointer, keyboard, and several for various
View [`Behaviors`](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Core/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/core/Behavior.kt#L7)
(i.e. [`nativeTextFieldBehavior()`](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Browser/src/jsMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/theme/native/NativeTheme.kt#L108))
which loads the native behavior for TextFields. We also define some bindings
directly in a new module. These are items with no built-in module, or items that only exist in our app code.

:::tip
Check out Kodein to learn more about how it handles dependency injection.
:::

The `application` function also takes an optional HTML element within which the app will be hosted. The app will be hosted in
`document.body` if you do not specify an element.

App launching is the only part of our code that is platform-specific; since it is the only time we might care
about an HTML element. It also helps support embedding apps into non-Doodle contexts.

## Supporting Docs Embedding

These docs actually launch the app using a custom `main` with a slightly different set of inputs. The big difference is in
`FilterButtonProvider` used. The docs inject a provider that creates `PushButton`s instead of `HyperLink`s for the filter
controls. The app itself treats these the same. The end result is that the docs version does not use routing.

```kotlin
// Notice the element is provided for embedded version
application(root = element, modules = listOf(FontModule, PointerModule, KeyboardModule, basicLabelBehavior(),
        nativeTextFieldBehavior(), nativeHyperLinkBehavior(), nativeScrollPanelBehavior(smoothScrolling = true),
        Module(name = "AppModule") {
            // ...

            // Different behavior for docs version
            bind<FilterButtonProvider>() with singleton { EmbeddedFilterButtonProvider(instance()) }
        }
)) {
    // load app just like full-screen
    TodoApp(instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance(), instance())
}
```
